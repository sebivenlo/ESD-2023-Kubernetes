Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) manages your hosted Kubernetes environment and makes it simple to deploy and manage containerized apps in Azure. Your AKS environment is enabled with features such as automated updates, self-healing, and easy scaling. The cluster is managed by Azure and is free. You manage the agent nodes in the cluster and only pay for the VMs on which your nodes run.

With AKS, you get the benefits of open-source Kubernetes without the complexity of operational overhead compared to running your own, custom cluster.
